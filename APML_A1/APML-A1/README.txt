We were slightly confused about the questions we saw scattered throughout the notebook. 
From what our TA told us, the grading will mainly happen within the report, so we answered these questions within the story of our report.
However, if for the next assignments you'd rather us answer these question within the notebook, we can do this as well.
Or maybe these questions are just to set you on the right path when we're experimenting.
